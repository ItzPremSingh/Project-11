# Write a program in python to calculate speed of a vehicle for entered distance and time.

d = int(input("Enter the distance (in metre): "))
t = int(input("Enter the time (in second): "))

print("Speed of vehicle is", d / t, "m/s")


# Output

# Enter the distance (in metre): 100
# Enter the time (in second): 20
# Speed of vehicle is 5.0 m/s
